    <h1>My First Site, Myself, Hobbies, Art</h1>
    <p>I am taking this class because I want to learn more about technology 
        and how sites and programs works. My hopes are to get better in using my computer
        more as my everyday basis work tool.</p>
    <h2>About Myself and My hobbies</h2>
    <h3>I'M 23 years old, I'm Brazilian, I love disco and classic slow rock music
        my hobby before was to customize shoes and making new tattoo flashes, as 
        I worked as a tattoo artist back in 2022. I do plan on getting back to 
        tattooing sometime in the future.I'll be showing some of the flash 
        drawings I did and a few tattoos done by me as well.
        My new hobby is to customize knives, mainly pocket knives.</h3>
